gnuplot of CPU/HDD/External Temperature
========================================

Some basic scripts to plot the CPU, HDD and external temperature of a system. 
This is based on a Centos 6.5 install and uses sensord and smartctl for the internal system temperatures. 
For the external temperature I have used an external RS232 temperature probe, this outputs a temperature every 10 seconds.

This is all running on a FITpc2.
